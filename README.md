Adds a control panel to the clan members page that allows you to collect data from all the members.

# Instructions
1. [Click here to install](https://github.com/dang-nabbit/gos-lucky-spider/raw/master/gos-lucky-spider.user.js) (requires Violentmonkey, Tampermonkey or similar).
1. Navigate to clan members page.
1. A Lucky Spider control panel will appear on top of the members list, containg the following items:
  - **"Release Lucky Spider" button**: Starts skittering around each members page and collecting data. During this process, the button label will change to "Retrieve Lucky Spider" and the page will move back and forth between player profiles and clan members page. If you click the "Retrieve Lucky Spider" button or move away from either of these pages, the data collection will pause until you click the "Release Lucky Spider" button again. Then, it will continue from where it stopped.
  - **Data text area**: Shows all the data collected by the spider. You can select the whole content to copy/paste on the info sheet.
  - **Copy data button**: Automatically selects the whole content of the text area and copies to clipboard.
  - **Reset spider button**: Resets the data collected and sets "done" player count to zero to allow the spider to start over from scratch.
